\section*{1)}

\subsection*{a)}

Let $G=S_{8}$. Show $H=\left\{ \left(1\right),\left(154\right)\left(326\right)\left(78\right),\left(154\right)\left(326\right),\left(145\right)\left(362\right),\left(145\right)\left(362\right)\left(78\right),\left(78\right)\right\} $
is a subgroup of $G$.

\subsection*{b)}

Find the orbits of $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$ in $H$.

\subsection*{c)}

Find the stabilizers of $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$ in $H$.

\section*{2)}

Write the Multiplication Table (Cayley Table) for each of the following
groups. Use these tables to write the permutation group corresponding
to this multiplication table.

\subsection*{a)}

$D_{4}$

\subsection*{b)}

$V_{4}=\left\langle a,b|a^{2}=b^{2}=e,ab=ba\right\rangle $

\section*{3)}

Let $H$ be a subset of $S_{5}$, such that $H=\left\{ \alpha\in S_{5}|\alpha\left(1\right)=1,\alpha\left(3\right)=3\right\} $. 

\subsection*{a)}

Show $H$ is a subgroup of $S_{5}$.

\subsection*{b)}

How many elements are in $H$?

\subsection*{c)}

What proportion of the elements of $S_{5}$ are in $H$? (Hint, there
are $n!$ possible permutations on $n$ objects).

\section*{4)}

Suppose $\alpha,\beta$ are both permutations on $n$ elements. Prove
that exactly one of $\alpha,\beta$ is odd if $\alpha\beta$ is odd.

\section*{5)}

A standard soccer ball (football if you prefer) has $12$ regular
pentagonal faces, $20$ regular hexagonal faces, $60$ vertices, and
$90$ edges. Mathematically, we call this shape a truncated icosahedron.
A rotating diagram and more information about this polyhedron is provided
on the Wikipedia page here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated\_icosahedron.
We will count the number of symmetries of the truncated icosahedron. 

\subsection*{a)}

Number each of the pentagonal faces. Pick a pentagonal face. How many
rotations of the soccer ball fix this pentagonal face?

\subsection*{b)}

Under the set of rotations of the soccer ball, what is the orbit of
the pentagon face you chose from \textbf{a)}?

\subsection*{c)}

Using orbit stabilizer theorem, with the numbers from \textbf{a)}
and \textbf{b}), determine the number of symmetries of the soccer
ball.

\subsection*{d)}

Now, number each of the hexagonal faces. Pick a hexagonal face. How
many rotations of the soccer ball fix this hexagonal face? (Hint:
a rotation of $60^{o}$ about a hexagonal face is not a symmetry of
the soccer ball)

\subsection*{e)}

Under the set of rotations of the soccer ball, what is the orbit of
the hexagonal face you chose from \textbf{d)}?

\subsection*{f)}

Using orbit stabilizer theorem, with the numbers from \textbf{d)}
and \textbf{e)}, determine the number of symmetries of the soccer
ball.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

Even though we are describing the symmetries of a soccer ball, this
same method is used when counting the symmetries of various molecules.
It turns out the rotational symmetries of the soccer ball are the
same as the rotational symmetries of a Buckyball. More information
about Buckyballs can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminsterfullerene

\section*{6)}

Pick any polyhedron from the wikipedia page below (besides the platonic
solids, as we have discussed these in class). State the polyhedron,
and calculate the number of rotational symmetries using orbit-stabilizer
theorem.
