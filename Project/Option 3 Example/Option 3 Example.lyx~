There are many different ways to draw this graph, but the above form is
 one of the more common drawings.
 This method of drawing has a couple of key features to note.
 First, note that the outside and inside sets of nodes both contain the
 same number of nodes (5).
 Second, note that we connect each node of the inside set of nodes with
 it's corresponding node in the outside set of nodes.
 Also note that the inside nodes are connecting by adding 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 mod 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 to each numbered node on the inside.
 Note, we made sure to label the nodes clockwise in the inside set of nodes.
 This leads to a more general notion of the Petersen graph.

Informally, the generalized Petersen Graph 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(n,k\right)$
\end_inset

 contains 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 nodes in the inside set of nodes and the outside set of nodes.
 The outside nodes will all be connected in a single cycle, each inside
 node will be connected to exactly one inside node, and the inside nodes
 will be connected by adding 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 mod 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 (Provided we are careful to number our inside nodes in the same order as
 the outside nodes).

Properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After drawing a few of these types of graphs, we may ask questions about
 when certain properties of the graph apply.
 Let's try to prove a couple!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inside subgraph will be connected if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $n,k$
\end_inset

 are relatively prime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Terminology)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we prove this, let's make sure we are clear on some terminology.
 The inside subgraph is the graph that is formed by removing every node
 in the outside set of nodes as well as all edges containing these nodes.
 The inside subgraph of 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(5,2\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(6,2\right)$
\end_inset

 are pictured below:

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Informally, we say a graph is connected if it is in one piece.
 We say a graph is disconnected if it is in more than one piece.
 Formally, we say a graph is connected if you can find a path from any node
 to any other node in the graph, and a graph is disconnected otherwise.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(5,2\right)$
\end_inset

 is connected, but 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(6,2\right)$
\end_inset

 is not.
 Now, we have the tools we need to prove the property! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
pf)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall the for the group 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$
\end_inset

 under addition, that 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$
\end_inset

 is a generator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$
\end_inset

 iff 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is relatively prime to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 That is each element in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be visited by repeatedly adding 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to itself.
 This allows us to visit each node in the inside subgraph by repeatedly
 connected every 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 nodes if 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is relatively prime to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 As this property of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$
\end_inset

 is an iff statement, then it is also true that 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(n,k\right)$
\end_inset

 will be disconnected if 
\begin_inset Formula $n,k$
\end_inset

 are not relatively prime.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is not a generator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$
\end_inset

, so it cannot be possible to visit every element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$
\end_inset

 by repeatedly adding 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 (and thus it is not possible to visit every vertex by connecting every
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 vertices).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphs 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(n,k\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(n,n-k\right)$
\end_inset

 are isomorphic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Terminology)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we prove this, let's make sure we are clear on terminology.
 When we say two graphs are isomorphic, we mean that the two graphs have
 the same structure.
 Informally, we can pair each node in the first graph with exactly one other
 node in the second graph such that if two nodes are connected in the first
 graph, then the corresponding nodes in the second graph must be connected,
 and vice versa.
 An example of two isomorphic graphs is shown below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename C:/Users/Patrick/Desktop/Math 320/Project/Option 3 Example/Isomorphism Example.png
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that in both graphs, each labeled node in the left graph is connected
 to nodes with the exact same labels in the right graph and vice versa.
 Also note that each node contains exactly one label and that each label
 appears exactly once in each graph.
 With this idea of isomorphism in mind, let's prove the theorem!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
pf)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we use the same labeling scheme for both 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(n,k\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(n,n-k\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The outside nodes will contain the same connections in both graphs, as
 both sets of outside nodes will be a cycle labeled clockwise.
 Likewise, the connections between the outside and inside nodes will be
 the same as these graphs will share the same labeling scheme, and thus
 the same connection rule between the inside and outside sets of nodes.
 What remains is to show that the inside set of nodes shares the exact same
 connections in both graphs.
 That is inside nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v$
\end_inset

 will be connected in the first graph iff corresponding nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $u',v'$
\end_inset

 are connected in the second graph.
 We know if two inside nodes in the first graph are connected, then 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u-v\equiv_{n}k
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v-u\equiv_{n}k
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose WLOG that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u-v\equiv_{n}k
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
then
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\left(u-v\right)\equiv_{n}-k
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v-u\equiv_{n}n-k
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $u',v'$
\end_inset

 must be connected in the second graph.
 Now, suppose nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $u',v'$
\end_inset

 are connected in the second graph.
 That is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u'-v'\equiv_{n}n-k
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v'-u'\equiv_{n}n-k
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose WLOG that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u'-v'\equiv_{n}n-k
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
then
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\left(u'-v'\right)\equiv_{n}-\left(n-k\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v'-u'\equiv_{n}k-n\equiv_{n}k
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v$
\end_inset

 must be connected in the first graph.
 As we have shown a connection between two the inside nodes in 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(n,k\right)$
\end_inset

 implies connection of the corresponding nodes in 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(n,n-k\right)$
\end_inset

 and vice versa, then we have proven the theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is just scratching the surface of the properties of these types of
 graphs, but hopefully this provides an introduction to this family of graphs.
 For more information about these graphs, a good place to start is on Wikipedia.
 These proofs are my own, but more formal definitions also came from the
 same Wikipedia page.
